0.2.1 (2023-12-19)
------------------

* Fixes bug in generating the report. If there were multiple alleles at a certain site (on a certain line in the vcf), this would crash pypolca. Exception handling has been added.

0.2.0 (2023-11-05)
------------------

* Fixes bug where `pypolca` would always warn it found 0 variants.
* Also would result in the polishing not working. 
* Please upgrade if you have used v0.1.1!
* Adds benchmarking of `pypolca` v0.2.0 vs POLCA more thoroughly. 

0.1.1 (2023-10-09)
------------------

* Patch release to fix the release.yaml uploads to pypi.

0.1.0 (2023-10-09)
------------------

* Initial release
