# pypolca

`pypolca` is a Standalone Python re-implementation of the POLCA polisher from the [MaSuRCA genome assembly and analysis toolkit](https://github.com/alekseyzimin/masurca).

`pypolca` also adds a `--careful` flag that we have shown is (generally) the best performing short-read bacterial isolate genome polishing option across a range of depths and samples.

The `‑‑careful` flag requires at least 4 reads to support the alternative allele, and a minimum ratio of 3 (i.e. at least three times as many reads must support the alterative allele compared to the reference allele). This prevents almost all false positives at low depths without sacrificing error removal sensitivity.

**Therefore, we recommend you always use `pypolca` with `--careful`**

## Quick Start

```
# creates conda environment with pypolca 
conda create -n pypolca_env pypolca

# activates conda environment
conda activate pypolca_env

# runs pypolca with --careful
pypolca run -a <genome> -1 <R1 short reads file> -2 <R2 short reads file> -t <threads> -o <output directory> --careful

## Description

`pypolca` is a python reimplenetation of the POLCA polisher from the [MaSuRCA genome assembly and analysis toolkit](https://github.com/alekseyzimin/masurca) that was made for inclusion into the hybrid bacterial genome assembly tool [hybracter](https://github.com/gbouras13/hybracter).

It was written for a number of reasons:

* MaSuRCA is only available on Linux, not for MacOS.
* The original `polca.sh` script from MaSuRCA was difficult to use because you could not specify an output directory. Additionally, due to its shell implementation, both FASTQ read files needed to be input together as a string
* To use `polca.sh`, you need to install the entire MaSuRCA assembly toolkit.
* POLCA is recommended for long-read first bacterial assembly polishing (see [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010905)) and I wanted to include it for MacOS and Linux in [hybracter](https://github.com/gbouras13/hybracter).

Note: I neither guarantee nor desire that `pypolca` will give identical results to POLCA implemented in MaSuRCA. This is because of the different versions of [freebayes](https://github.com/freebayes/freebayes) and Samtools that might be used as a dependency. 

In testing, `pypolca` v0.2.0 (running Freebayes v1.3.6 and Samtools v1.18) was extremely similar, but not identical to POLCA (running Freebayes v1.3.1-dirty and Samtools v0.1.20). Please see [benchmarking](benchmarking.md) for more details.

I have decided to use the newest versions of freebayes and Samtools possible rather than the version installed with MaSuRCA, for ease of maintenance and particularly because the version of Samtools used is a major version behind and the CLI has changed. 

Note: as of 21 March 2025, I bumped the dependency of freebayes to v1.3.9. Testing shows identical results to v1.3.6 and it is compatible with Apple Silicon MacOSX builds.(As an aside, v1.3.7 conda package appears to be broken)

### Note of Caution for Large (e.g. Eukaryotic) Genomes

* I have implemeted `pypolca` predominantly for the use-case of polishing long-read bacterial genome assemblies with short reads. Therefore, I decided not to implement the batched multiprocessing of freebayes included in POLCA, because it was a lot of work for no benefit for most bacterial genomes. 
* However, this is certainly not true for larger genomes such as eukaryotic organisms. `pypolca` should be a lot slower than POLCA for such organisms if you run both with more than 1 thread. 
* I do not intend to implement multiprocessing but if someone wants to feel free to make a PR.

## Installation

Installation from conda is recommended as this will install all non-python dependencies.

### Conda

`pypolca` is available on bioconda.

```
conda install -c bioconda pypolca
```

### Pip

You can also install the Python components of `pypolca` with pip.

```
pip install pypolca
```

### Container

If you have Docker/Singularity/Apptainer installed, you can use the [biocontainers container](https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/pypolca?tab=tags) (yes, every bioconda package has one!)

For example to install `pypolca v0.3.1` with Singularity

```
IMAGE_DIR="<the directory you want the .sif file to be in >"
singularity pull --dir $IMAGE_DIR docker://quay.io/biocontainers/pypolca:0.3.1--pyhdfd78af_0

containerImage="$IMAGE_DIR/pypolca_0.3.1--pyhdfd78af_0.sif"
singularity exec $containerImage pypolca run -h
```


### Source

Alternatively, the development version of `pypolca` can be installed manually via github.

```
git clone https://github.com/gbouras13/pypolca.git
cd pypolca
pip install -e .
pypolca -h
```

If you have install `pypolca` with pip or from source, you will then need to install the external dependencies separately, which can be found in `build/environment.yaml`

* [bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) >=0.7.17
* [Samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools) >=1.18
* [freebayes](https://github.com/freebayes/freebayes) >=1.3.1,<1.3.7
